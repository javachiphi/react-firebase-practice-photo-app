# React with Firebase DB Practice

## Overview
This project is a practice exercise in integrating Firebase with a React-based application, based on Rocket Academy's [Instagram Chat project]([url](https://github.com/rocketacademy/instagram-bootcamp)). It uses Firebase in managing real-time data, authentication, storage, and hosting within a React application.

   - Structuring data in a NoSQL JSON database
   - Configuring real-time database rules
2. Firebase Storage

3. Firebase Authentication
   - Implementing a secure authentication system.
4. Firebase Hosting:
   - Deploying web applications to Firebase hosting for global access.
